 Introduction:
===============

Tetris is one of my first games I wrote to learn programming long time ago. I
lost the origianl source code due to hard disk faliur, but I managed to
decompile .NET executable with ILSpy. I documented the history of this game in
this [Tetris](https://tjs87.wordpress.com/2011/05/12/tetris/) weblog post.
